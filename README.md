# Monster-Maker
easier way to create monsters


If you wanna use images in the programme, should add them to the correct folder(addons, items, mounts, effects .etc)

1. Images must have .git extension (not .jpg, .png, .etc)
2. Addons, items, mounts must be named numerically
3. Area and shoot effects must have named in words(redspark, poff, bubblespark .etc)
